# arduinoparking
A completed  ArduinoIDE project which imitates a car parking system, has features that require an Arduino UNO.
Aim- to program the Arduino as a parking management system. It will read custom input
messages over the Serial Interface, process them, and then display the result on the screen. The Arduinoâ€™s buttons will allow for interaction with the information displayed on the LCD. We will introduce the concepts of custom messages and vehicle information. 

The project also includes a document detailing the depth of the code and all its implemented functions.
